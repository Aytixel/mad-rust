# Mad Rust

Mad Rust is a free software for controlling, and changing the profile of your Mad Catz equipments.

**⚠️ Please take attention to this, Mad Rust is not an official software and potentially unstable, I am not responsible for any damage at your equipment.**

For now, this software only supports MMO7 mouse, but feel free to create your own driver.
Moreover, it is not a real driver, which allows it to be cross-platform.

# Windows installation

On Windows, you will have to change the driver of your equipment, to Winusb or libusb.
For that I recommend you to use the [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie) software to change it.
**Else Mad Rust will not be able to access it.**

# Linux installation

On Linux if you don't have libxdo installed, you will need to install it with : **"sudo apt-get install libxdo-dev".**

# Running the MMO7 driver

On each system, it's recommended to run the driver in admin mode.
Otherwise, it might cause some problems due to permissions.
