# Mad Rust

Mad Rust is a free software for controlling, and changing the profile of your Mad Catz equipments.

**⚠️ Please take attention to this, Mad Rust is not an official software and potentially unstable, I am not responsible for any damage at your equipment.**

For now, this software only supports MMO7 mouse, but feel free to create your own driver.
Moreover, it is not a real driver, which allows it to be cross-platform.
